# N-ary_Tree_postorder

ðŸš€ Solving Problems at Scale | Open-Source Contributor
What I Build:
âœ” Algorithmic Solutions (Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming)
âœ” Optimized Code (From brute force to O(n) magic)
âœ” Developer Tools (Making coding interviews less painful)

Why It Matters:
I turn complex problems into simple, reusable solutionsâ€”because clean code should be accessible to everyone.

Featured Projects:

N-ary Tree Visualizer (Because debugging trees shouldnâ€™t hurt)

LeetCode Patterns Cheatsheet (500+ problems distilled)

Pythonic Data Structures (Implemented from scratch)
